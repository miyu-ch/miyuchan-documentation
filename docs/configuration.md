# Configuration
## This is the most important thing if you want to start using Miyuchan correctly.

To start configuring Miyuchan, write `/configuration`,  
if perfectly executed, you should get a message like this:
![Configuration message](assets/first_configuration_panel.png)  
  
Do as the message says and re-do the commande once more, and you will eventually get a message like this
![Configuration panel](assets/configuration_panel.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> Only a user with `administrator` permission is able to execute this command.  

### As you can see, the configuration panel provides a lot of features that can be managed, you will find a documentation for each feature right below
