# Creating a group
## It's the first step if you want to create a group

Start creating your group by doing `/group_create`  
You will be asked to fill in 2-3 options :  
* `group_name` It's your group name.
* `group_bio` Your group bio.
* `group_avatar` (Optional) Your group avatar.

Here is a basic example:  

![Creating a group](../assets/2_groups.png)  
For the example, I have chosen to not specify a group avatar  

And so after doing this command, you should get the following message:  
![Well done](../assets/1_groups.png)

Congrats, you have just created your group. To see it you can either do `/group` or `/group your_group_name`
