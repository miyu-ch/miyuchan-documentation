# Auto-Nick
## When a new member joins your server, they will get a nickname

As you clicked on the button "Auto-nick" from the configuration panel, you will get this window:  
![First step](../assets/1_autonick.png)

In this window you are asked to enter a nickname for new members, if you leave it blank it will just reset it.
For example:

![Second step](../assets/2_autonick.png)

So now with this set, when a new member will join they will get the nickname `A Normal User` automatically.
