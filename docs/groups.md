# Groups
## Interested in groups ? You want to create one or know everything about them ? Here is what you need !

First of all, you can view a group by doing `/group name`  
For example if there is a group called `Miyuchan`, you can view it with `/group Miyuchan`
> [!NOTE]
> the group name can be written in uppercases, lowercases and even LiKe ThAt.
You can also know someone's group by seeing their `/rank member`. Their group will be written at the bottom.

### Groups (or Miyuchan Groups) provide the following docs:

* [Creating a group](groups_docs/create.md)
